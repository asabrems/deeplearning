# deeplearning
This repository contains an implementation of pytorch's autograder.
the repository contains various modules in pytorch used in deeplearning. 
Project 1: Implementation of an mlp with the linear layer class, sequential, relu
Project 2: Implmentation of a 1D CNN. Moreover, the concept of Single Scanning MLP and Distributed Scanning MLPs were implemented 
Project 3: Implementation of RNNs, GRU, packed and unpacked sequence, CAt, slice and Unsqueeze functions
Project 4: Implementation of the concept of encoders and decoders

#note the functional libraries contains various functions like add, multipy, dvision, sum and many more
This project was supervised in a deeplearning course in CMU.
